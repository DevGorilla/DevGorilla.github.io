I buy interesting looking cookbooks at thrift stores. Sometimes this nets me duds. I'm looking at you weird smoke-infuse-all-the-things-book. This find renewed my faith in the hunt.
</p>

<p>
The Tassajara is a <a href="https://www.sfzc.org/locations/tassajara">Zen Center</a> in San Francisco and the book, first published in 1970, catalogs simple no-fuss bread recipes they would use to feed visitors to the center. How simple are these recipes? While there are yeasted breads in the book, many are made in 30 minutes or less. The authors also include compound butters, baked breakfast goods and sweets. The house favorite is recipe <em>#45 - Apple Pancake Sam</em>. A little flour, milk, eggs and apple and you have a breakfast in a half hour.

My grandmother was a cook at a cult-like NGO in the 1950s to the mid 1960s. The Tassajara simple sensibility was mirrored in my grandmother's baking. There was nothing too flashy. No glazes or overly sweet components. If sweetness was desired some fresh fruit might have been used. I'm not sure if this was the cult's influence, a left over ideal from the depression era or just that my grandmother was trying to be healthy in her 70s. In fact, it's possible the bread my Grandma made us was recipe <em>#1 Tassajara Bread</em> - it looks very similar.

Alternatively I have this excellent <a href="https://a.co/d/3EO0aHz">bread book</a>, but starting a recipe remains on the todo list since it's a multi-day event. I missed out on the sourdough craze during covid because I was walling in an office in my house featuring the horrible attempt at knockdown texture you see in the Tassajara book image above. It got better with each wall.
