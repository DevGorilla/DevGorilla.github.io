I turned to this medium mostly out of appreciation for the random web 1.0 sites I bump into on occasion as I research weird niche topics.

While sewing myself a diaper bag a few months before my second son was born I found <a href="https://www.justus.ws/craft/right-to-roam-rucksack/">Justus Grunow's post on the Merchant Mills ruck</a> and I was reminded how much I loved Web 1.0. Instead of billionaire's feeds and algorithms determining how our content was curated and displayed, we had personal sites. Mine was on geocities with worse style than here with <code class="language-html">marquee</code> tags and auto-playing music.

I'll still be on social media as that's how I connect with people who also make and build things, but it just makes sense to me to have a place for long form project posts.
