I turned to this medium mostly out of appreciation for the random web 1.0 sites I bump into on occasion as I research weird niche topics.

While sewing myself a diaper bag a few months before my second son was born I found <a href="https://www.justus.ws/craft/right-to-roam-rucksack/">Justus Grunow's post on the Merchant Mills ruck</a> and I was reminded how much I loved Web 1.0. Instead of billionaire's feeds and algorithms determining how our content was curated and displayed, we had personal sites. Mine was on geocities with worse style than here with <code class="language-html">marquee</code> tags and auto-playing music.

I'll still be on social media as that's how I connect with people who also make and build things, but it just makes sense to me to have a place for long form project posts. 


<!-- On his own "Why does this site exist" page, Justus says,
<blockquote>
It's a mild allergic reaction to social media. It’s a place to put things I care about. It's a place to experiment and have fun. It's a place where I don't have to worry about likes or whether one or 100 people are looking at what I'm putting out there. It's in the tradition of putting time into creating a personal website as a creative expression. Remember GeoCities? It's a modern GeoCities site. It's Web 1.0. It's a personal website. The personal website—once abundant and never quite endangered but certainly threatened—is making a comeback. This is my corner of the internet.

What Justus said of his own site rang true for me. Im a 3rd generation (at <em>least</em>) compulsive maker and I've mostly used Instagram to posting projects I'm working on and to network with others who do the same. Slowly though, the App's focus changed from a linear feed of what had been posted by your friends to a prioritized list: reels or video ranked higher with posts they think you don't want to see removed from view altogether while prioritizing you endlessly scrolling.

Regardless, I'll still be on social media as that's how I connect with people who also make and build things, but it just makes sense to me to have a place for long form project posts.  -->
