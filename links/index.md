### MYOG
 Make Your Own Gear. The name came out of ultralight backpackers building their own gear, but largely it's expanded to sewing gear at home for all kinds of outdoor adventures. Currently I use a Juki DL-555 with a consew servo upgrade and an <a href="https://sewinginsight.com/reviews/bernina-bernette-funlock-004d-review/">Bernette Funlock 004-d</a> for serging.

### Wood Boat Building

Plans, images, books. 

A nomadic Rhode Islander, my grandfather built several boats over his lifetime. Greenland kayaks for his sons in the 1960s, row boats and a sailboat when he lived on Whidbey Island. I was too young to help but I rowed the boat in his seasonal pond and we sailed Penn Cove on his plywood sailboat with him in the late 90s. I've been researching and reading about building, but I haven't settled yet on a project to begin. My ideal boat has an open floor plan and can be used in most of the waters in the PNW. Large rivers, the Puget Sound and lakes. So far a flat bottom boat with a higher freeboard seems like it may be ideal for my purpose. Something like [Payson's Clamskiff](https://smallboatsmonthly.com/article/clam-skiff/) may fit the bill, or a Pacific City Dory. I'll probably just build a small 2-3 person boat while I enjoy a larger professionally built boat in the sound. I think a quick win would make motivating a year long boat build easier.
