<h1>Eddieville</h1>
<p style="margin-top:30px">
Unlike Round 2 at Horn Rapids, where I was riding the completely unknown-to-me deep sand, Eddieville offered up the opposite. Axle deep mud. If there's anything I know from riding year-round in western washington its slippery muck.
</p>

It didn't pay off much though. It was more fun than the sand, but I slid out a 9th place finish of 14 in Vet-C. I was told in line at the end I took 2nd place based off my transponder, then 6th when I dropped of my handlebar tag and the final score on the website has me down at 9th. Im unsure what happened there, but was still fun. A friend of mine broke his hand and several riders in Vet-C DNF'd. So Im still happy about a finish.
